  * Remove SHARED (#1305 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/1305>) (#1421 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/1421>)
    When the module is compiled with MODULE (the default), the proper linker flags are added on macOS (specifically -undefined dynamic_lookup). Otherwise, rclpy segfaults when linked on conda.
    Is the SHARED really necessary? The pybind11 documentation says:
    > Specifying SHARED will create a more traditional dynamic library which can also be linked from elsewhere.

  * Fixes spin_until_future_complete inside callback (#1316 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/1316>) (#1341 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/1341>)
    Closes rclpy:#1313 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/1313>
    Current if spin_unitl_future_complete is called inside a nodes callback it removes the node from the executor
    This results in any subsiquent waitables to never be checked by the node since the node is no longer in the executor
    This aims to fix that by only removing the node from the executor if it wasn't already present

  * Fix a bad bug in fetching the lifecycle transitions. (#1321 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/1321>) (#1322 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/1322>)
    We were fetching one more lifecycle transition than existed
    in the source list (i.e. we should use < instead of <=).
    In turn, this allows us to enable the test_lifecycle.py test,
    and to fix the spurious "empty" string in the expected states.

ros-jazzy-rclpy (0.5.3-1bookworm) bookworm; urgency=high

  * use test_msgs instead of std_msgs (#204 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/204>)
  * Fixes memory leaks for nested fields (#203 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/203>)
    This separates memory allocation out from convert_from_py function.
    Now it uses separate create_message function to allocate message,
    making it explicit gives better control where and how memory is
    allocated and freed.

ros-jazzy-rclpy (0.5.0-1bookworm) bookworm; urgency=high

  * Changed the rclpy signal handler so that it is registered in ``rclpy_init()`` rather than in each wait. (#194 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/194>)
  * Changed the signal handler in rclpy to call the original signal handler when receiving SIGINT during a wait on a wait set. (#191 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/191>)
  * Added API for counting the number of publishers and subscribers on a topic. (#183 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/183>)
  * Updated Node interface so it can use the command line arguments and can optionally ignore global arguments. (#185 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/185>)

  * Fixed ``rclpy_init()`` so that it actually passes command line arguments to ``rcl_init()`` (#179 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/179>)
  * Changed logging to get the node's logger name from rcl. (#174 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/174>)

  * Disable 1kHz timer tests on the ARM architectures. (#169 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/169>)
    * Publish parameter events.
    Adds a parameter event publisher to rclpy nodes.
